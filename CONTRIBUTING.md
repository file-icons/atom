Adding new icons to the package
===============================

If a desired icon isn't included in one of the [existing icon-font packages](README.md#fonts),
you can add it to the package's custom icon set with [IcoMoon.io](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select):

1. Click the **Import Icons** button in the top-left corner.

2. Pick `selection.json` from the package's base directory.

3. You may be presented with a dialogue asking *"Your icon selection was loaded. Would you like to load all the settings stored in your selection file?"*. If so, click **Yes**.

4. Add your desired icon/s.

5. Export and extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to your fork's `fonts-src` directory.
