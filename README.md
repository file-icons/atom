A number of icons and colours are provied by default for a range of common file types.
If you have file that you would like custom icons for you can easily add this yourself.

File Icons are now specified via css(less) only.

## No Colours

*Colourless icons is now a setting in the atom preferences*

You can now add this to your user stylesheet
```css
@import "packages/file-icons/features/no-colours";
```

## Unity Theme

By default the Unity theme hides icons

*Force show icons is now a setting in the atom preferences*

You can now remove this from your user stylesheet
```css
@import "packages/file-icons/features/force-show-icons";
```

# Customisation

The following css can be added to your user stylesheet to customise files with the .rb file extension

```css
@import "packages/file-icons/stylesheets/colors"; // to use the colours
@import "packages/file-icons/stylesheets/icons";  // to use the defined icons
```

```css
@import "packages/file-icons/stylesheets/items";
@{pane-tab-selector}, .icon-file-text {
  &[data-name$=".rb"]          { .medium-red;             } // Colours icon and filename
  &[data-name$=".rb"]:before   { .ruby-icon; .medium-red; } // Colours icon only
  &[data-name$=".rb"]:before   { .ruby-icon; .medium-red; } // Colours icon only
}
```

@{pane-tab-selector}, .icon-file-directory {
  &[data-name=".git"]:before { .git-icon; }
}
```

## Icons

## Colours

Colours are from the [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) colour palette. CSS classes used to apply color follow its primary 8 (eight) colours and 3 (three) variants:

  * Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Maroon, Purple, Orange, Cyan
  * Light, Medium, Dark.

Medium is colour provided by Base16. Light is medium lightened 15%. Dark is medium darkened 15%. In order to "construct" a CSS class color, you provide its variant followed by a dash (-).

```css
.light-red;
.medium-blue;
.dark-maroon;
```
